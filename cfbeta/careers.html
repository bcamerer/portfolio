              <p><strong>Job Location:</strong>&nbsp;USA, non-location-specific<br>
<strong>Regional Description:</strong>&nbsp;Virginia<br>
<strong>Job Number:</strong>&nbsp;00101</p><br />
<p>CloudFit Software provides managed scenarios for core operational outcomes.&nbsp;For example, as a customer creates an app using an agile, DevOps approach the customer has two options: 1) have the dev team oversee/babysit their automation 24×7 or 2) have their existing operations team (insourced or outsourced) provide core operations oversite.&nbsp;There are adverse implications to both approaches.&nbsp;CloudFit’s managed scenarios give a third option: move fast while CloudFit provides the core operational outcomes&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;integrates back with the customer’s existing operations team whether insourced, outsourced or in-between.</p><br />
<p>CloudFit has a team of talented individuals who implement and manage the managed scenarios and operational outcomes for our customers.&nbsp;And in some cases, customers want help to transform their own development and operations teams to be more fluid, and we are happy to help those customers drive those desired outcomes.&nbsp;Our team of talented professionals can deliver on any operational outcome.&nbsp;We call these individuals “Personal Trainers” rather than “Consultants”.&nbsp;In our view, consultants are great, but they are like a nutrition professor who might lecture on the theory of nutrition.&nbsp;Personal Trainers&nbsp;<em>master</em>&nbsp;the knowledge of nutrition, exercise, human motivation, and they&nbsp;<em>apply</em>&nbsp;that knowledge to help their clients change their lives for the better.&nbsp;Our CloudFit Personal Trainers are passionate about using their knowledge and experience to help CloudFit’s customers achieve their dreams.&nbsp;CloudFit Personal Trainers do not spew theory but rather have proven track records of driving measurable results in support of modern digital transformations.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p><strong><u>Job Description</u></strong></p>
<p>CloudFit Personal Trainers partner with our customers to help them transform both through managed scenarios and by rolling up their sleeves to help the customer transform their own operations.&nbsp;Our CloudFit Personal trainers all have unique experience and insights in how to help our customers transform with “just enough effort.” We will never advise a customer to change for the sake of change.&nbsp;Everything we do is aimed at helping the customer move faster and at higher quality towards&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;unique business goals.</p> <br />
<p>We are seeking experienced Cloud Service Management experts to join our growing CloudFit Personal Trainer team.&nbsp;This position will report directly to the CTO who is based in our offices in Lynchburg, VA, but the position is location agnostic and the role will work across the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br />
<p>The qualified candidate will have extensive experience in real-world cloud service engineering and management. CloudFit Personal Trainers must have lived and led through the pressure of moving critical applications to the cloud. Technical cloud certifications are highly desirable, but proven experience in cloud and DevOps Development or Service Engineering roles are even more desirable.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>CloudFit Personal Trainers would all be described as caring people who have customer satisfaction and service culture woven into their DNA.</p><br />
<p>The position will require travel (up to 75%).</p><br />
<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>

<li>Onboard and manage customers to CloudFit Managed Scenarios for core operational outcomes (e.g. “CloudFit will monitor your DevOps and/or Cloud application and we will page you and your traditional operations team when you are impacted.”)</li>
<li>Roll up your sleeves to train, guide and assist customers through the operationalization of their applications to DevOps and Cloud.</li>
<li>Maintain your edge in technology and methodology approaches in order to guide CloudFit’s customers through the pros and cons of every decision.</li>
 <br />
<p><strong>Required Qualifications:</strong></p>

<li>Technical IT delivery (or consulting) experience preferably Dev, Test, or Cloud.</li>
<li>Real-world DevOps experience.</li>
<li>Service Engineering Experience in a Cloud, Software, or Modern-IT company.</li>
<li>Cloud Service Engineering Experience (e.g. Office 365, Azure, AWS).</li>
<li>Engineering Program Manager in a Cloud or&nbsp;Software&nbsp;company.</li>
<li>Custom/Scripted Systems Management experience in a production environment.</li>
<li>Public speaking experience.</li>
 <br />
<p><strong>Preferred Qualifications:</strong></p>

<li>Cloud and DevOps certifications.</li>
<li>Proven track record of leading customers digital transformation though cloud services management.</li>
<li>Computer Science Degree.</li>
<li>Management Information Services Degree.</li>
<li>Experience guiding CxOs in the modern, digital workplace.</li>
<br />
<p>ITIL certifications and Traditional Service Management experience are acceptable, but they are not preferred. Such certifications and experience without meeting the required qualifications would actually be detrimental.&nbsp;CloudFit is not a traditional service management company, and we do not hire traditional service management consultants or practitioners.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>CloudFit is an equal opportunities employer and welcomes applications from all sections of society and does not discriminate on grounds of race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other basis as protected by applicable law.</p><br />

<p>While the CloudFit Personal Trainers are critical to customer outcomes, the core of CloudFit Software is our CloudFit Managed Scenarios.&nbsp;The CloudFit Managed Scenarios are delivered through the combination of amazing software, super-simple devices and [most importantly] crazy-smart-and-dedicated people.&nbsp;There are a number of delivery roles available within CloudFit’s Managed Scenarios Service Delivery organization including CloudFit Software Engineers and CloudFit Command and Control Engineers (CCEs).&nbsp;This Job Description is written for CloudFit Command and Control Engineers.</p><br />
<p>Join CloudFit Software and help transform leading organizations around the world. The sheer scale of our capabilities and client engagements including the way that we collaborate, operate and deliver value provides an unequalled opportunity to grow and advance. Choose CloudFit and make delivering innovative solutions part of your next career move.</p> <br />
<p><strong><u>Job Description</u></strong></p>
<p>CloudFit Command and Control Engineers (CCEs) protect our customers’ interests 24x7x365 as they backstop our CloudFit Software Automation.&nbsp;CloudFit CCEs engage with customers during high-stress situations, and CloudFit CCEs must be comfortable in high-stress situations with demanding customer executives.&nbsp;CloudFit CCEs will interface with customer business, development and operations personnel via phone, via tickets, and via email.</p><br />
<p>CloudFit CCEs will have a unique combination of qualities and skills.&nbsp;CloudFit is not a normal company.&nbsp;There has never been a company who has done what CloudFit is doing.&nbsp;Thus, CloudFit’s job requirements, especially for CCEs, differs from the industry norm.</p> <br />
<ol>
<li>Most importantly, due to the CloudFit’s culture of unheralded customer service, CloudFit CCEs must be proven leaders and contributors to creating a better world via volunteering, coaching, etc.&nbsp;CloudFit CCEs would all be described as caring people who have customer satisfaction and service culture woven into their DNA.&nbsp;Great customer service is only possible when individuals truly care about the person on the other side of the discussion.&nbsp;CloudFit CCEs will be well-proven in this area both professionally and personally.&nbsp;This requirement is non-negotiable.</li><br />
<li>Second, CloudFit CCEs will have proven&nbsp;<em>years</em>&nbsp;of experience in high-pressure, service-stoppage-recovery roles.&nbsp;This experience might be from years of mission-critical-IT-application support, through years of manufacturing-line-service-recovery-support, through being a soldier who is accustomed to intense, high-pressure situations, through medical device outage support, through logging equipment-service-recovery-while-work-is-stopped support, etc.&nbsp;This list is not intended to be inclusive.&nbsp;There are many possibilities to prove this sort of long-term, high-pressure, service-stoppage-recovery experience.&nbsp;The list is provided simply to help applications understand the sort of pressure-cooker experience that we are looking for&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to encourage candidates who do not have experience in typical IT environments.&nbsp;IT experience is not a requirement for this role.</li>
<br /><li>Third, CloudFit CCEs will have a proven track-record of dealing with angry executives during the worst of times.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with point #2, note this bullet does not require IT-specific experience.&nbsp;CCE candidates must be able to clearly articulate scenarios and real experiences to prove this ability.</li><br />
<li>Fourth and finally, CloudFit CCEs will have a technical background.&nbsp;Note that we are not calling out&nbsp;<em>technology</em>&nbsp;background but rather technical background.&nbsp;Mission-critical IT Service experience is appropriate.&nbsp;Master mechanics, Civil engineers, Master Electricians, Electrical Engineers, etc. are all appropriate.&nbsp;The CCE must be able to think logically in a technical manner—think “and/or gates” and complex “if/then statements”.&nbsp;This example list is not exhaustive.&nbsp;</li><br />
</ol>
<p>We are seeking experienced Cloud Command and Control Engineers to join our growing CloudFit CCE team in beautiful Downtown, Lynchburg, VA.&nbsp;This position will report up through the CTO along with all other CloudFit Service Delivery, Engineering, and Personal Trainer roles.&nbsp;CloudFit’s CTO is also based in our offices in Lynchburg, VA.</p><br />
<p>CCEs will typically run 4 x 10 hour shifts.&nbsp;Either Sunday thru Wednesday&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;Wednesday thru Saturday.&nbsp;7am to 5pm ET, 4pm to 2am ET, and 12am to 10am ET which includes overlapping shifts for peak hours and shift hand-offs as well as overlap on Wednesdays for training, meetings, etc.</p>
<br /><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>

<li>Monitor / backstop automation 24x7x365</li>
<li>Engage customers via phone, email and tickets</li>
<li>Provide Command and Control leadership on Major Incident Bridges</li>
<li>Interface with customer and CloudFit executive management both proactively and reactively</li>
<li>Support customers via phone, email, and tickets</li>
<br />
<p><strong>Required Qualifications:</strong></p>

<li>Proven track record of caring about others in professional and personal life</li>
<li>Proven track record of success while being “the-person-with-the-weight-on-his/her-shoulders” during critical situations</li>
<li>Proven track record of interfacing with executives who are stressed and/or unhappy during service-impacting-events</li>
<li>Proven technical thinker and proven technical experience</li>
<br />
<p><strong>Preferred Qualifications:</strong></p>

<li>Cloud and DevOps certifications</li>
<li>Proven track record of leading customers digital transformation though cloud services management</li>
<li>Engineering, Mathematics, Management Information Services or Computer Science Degree (or certificate)</li>
<br />
<p>ITIL certifications and Traditional Service Management experience are acceptable, but they are not preferred. Such certifications and experience without meeting the required qualifications would actually be detrimental.&nbsp;CloudFit is not a traditional service management company, and we do not hire traditional service management consultants or practitioners.&nbsp;It is unlikely that traditional IT Operations Center professionals would be a fit for CloudFit’s CCE positions; however, military Command and Control, NASA Command and Control, and other such experience would be fantastic.</p><br />
