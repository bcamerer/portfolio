					<h4 id="project-desc">Our goal for our research was to find what was below the top level desire of watching a football game. We used naturalistic observation during the fans times of viewing Seahawk games. We found after losses there was a serious cloud of sadness and isolation. During wins, there was a sense of victory and achievement.</h4>

					<h4 id="project-desc">During our research, we found that the quarterback received the most admiration and respect. We discovered getting him on board would provide high credibility for our users.

              <ul>
                  <li><b>Fans want to feel connected.</b> Celebrating with other fans is one of the highlights of the games. Rarely does anyone go to Seahawk games alone.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><b>Fans want adventure.</b> Getting caught up in something bigger than themselves provided them with value and identity. Being a "12th man" was an honor.</li>

					<h4 id="project-desc">We then filmed an initial screening and invited a large focus group to the Seahawk's practice facility for feedback. We discovered inviting fans in and making them feel that the session was exclusive gave them a greater buy-in. They felt like they were an integral part of the process. We took it a step further and invited them to hand out 28,000 copies of the film during a post-game exit from Century Link field. We also sweetened the deal by providing autographs from players after the game for extra incentive. The response from this focus group was overwhelming, over a hundred people volunteered. </h4>

					<h4 id="project-desc">We had the video but now we needed a way to get them to the next stage. We designed a web portal to allow them to find local churches in their community and gave a call to action at the end of the video. We also provided an online link to the video for fans who didn't want to watch the DVD.</h4>
