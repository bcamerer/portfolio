				<div class="col-md-6">

					<h4 id="project-desc">One common theme rose above them all, the issue of household chores. During our research, it was becoming more and more obvious that the underlying theme of conflict was some roommates felt like the others were not pulling their weight with chores in the house.</h4>

          <h4 id="project-desc">Now that we had found three primary types of roommates our task was now to find a way to make sure everyone pulled there weight. We needed to make sure "Look good Larry" wouldn't be taking credit for "Consistent Carl's" hard work. We also had to find a way to get "Sloppy Sam" off of the couch and involved with the household chores. This is when we realized that if we could get an accurate assessment of who is doing chores and who isn't, necessary conversations could happen between roommates. We had our idea, and now it was time to create the app that increases roommate collaboration for chores.</h4>

					<h4 id="project-desc">We decided the best way of accomplishing this task was to create a way to reward users for any household chores done around the house.

A little friendly competition and visual display of duties allowed for people to enjoy the chore process.</h4>

					<h4 id="project-desc">We began to see immediate results from our implementation of the app. "Sloppy Sam" who never did any chores was so excited about the app that it was hard to even find a chore in the house to do. "Consistent Carl" would always push the top of the leaderboards as well. "Look good Larry" could no longer ride the coattails of "Consistent Carl" and was accurately assessed how much he contributed.</h4>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h4 id="project-desc">We came to find when people are rewarded for their work it makes for a much more pleasant roommate situation. When roommates are feeling like another roommate is just being lazy they can check the data on the app to see if it is true. They no longer are under assumptions and they can have necessary conversations with the right people.</h4>
